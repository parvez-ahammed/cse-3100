# 🌀 Rick & Morty Explorer – Assignment 1

This project is an enhanced version of the base Rick and Morty Explorer assignment. It is a single-page React app that fetches character data from the public [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). I implemented and customized multiple features with dynamic UI improvements and added bonus functionality.

## ✅ What I Implemented

### 🔧 Core Features Implemented (as per assignment)
- Character list with name-based **search**
- Status-based **filter** (`Alive`, `Dead`, `Unknown`)
- **Pagination** using API’s page parameter (10 characters per page)
- **Character Detail Page** with dynamic routing and episode count
- **Contact Us Page** with full form validation and success message
- **About Us Page** with app info, my details, and a fun quote
- Clean routing using **React Router DOM**
- Reusable components like `CharacterCard`, `SearchBar`, `FilterDropdown`

### 🚀 Additional Improvements I Made
- Fully **responsive UI** using CSS
- **Dark/Light Mode** toggle with theme persistence
- Saved user search and filter inputs using `localStorage`
- Handled loading and error states gracefully for better UX
- Optimized project structure using modular folders (`features`, `components`, `hooks`, etc.)

- Form submission is local-only (no API endpoint/backend)
- Episode title fetching for character detail is still a planned bonus
