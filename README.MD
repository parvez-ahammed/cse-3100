# Rick & Morty Explorer – Assignment 1

In this project, I have build a beautiful and interactive single-page application that allows users to explore, filter, and view details about characters from the Rick and Morty universe using the public Rick and Morty API.

I have applied React and JavaScript skills, routing, API fetching, conditional rendering, and basic UX design.
