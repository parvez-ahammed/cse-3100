## AI Tool Usage :

I used ChatGPT during the Assignment.

## How used AI :

1.To Generate clean code structure for React components/pages(SearchBox,PaginationControls,StatusFilter,Contact).

2.To learn Clarify complex logic such as pagination, filtering with query parameters, and use of React hooks.

3.Save time by quickly debugging syntax issues and optimizing component design.
