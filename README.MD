## Assignment Instructions

You'll enhance the base Rick & Morty character explorer app with the following features and pages.

### 1. Character Details Page (2 marks)

On the main list, clicking a character should navigate to a dynamic route (e.g., /character/1) and display:

- Name
- Image
- Status
- Species
- Origin
- Last known location
- Number of episodes they appeared in

You must use React Router’s dynamic routing with the character ID.

### 2. Search + Filter Functionality (2 marks)

- Add a search box to filter characters by name.

- Add a dropdown to filter by status (Alive, Dead, Unknown).

- Filters must work together and persist in the URL via query parameters (e.g., ?name=rick&status=alive).

### 3. Pagination (2 marks)

- Use the API’s built-in pagination (?page=2) to add a “Next” and “Previous” button at the bottom.

- Show only 10 characters per page.

- Prevent going past first/last page.

### 4. Contact Us Page (2 marks)

Create a separate route /contact with a form that includes:

- Name
- Email
- Message
- Submit button
- Form validation (e.g., required fields, valid email format)
- On submit, display a success message and reset the form.

### 5. About Us Page (1 mark)

Static page /about with:

- Info about the app
- Developer
- Favorite Rick & Morty quote

### 6. Code Quality (1 mark)

- Clean code structure
- Reusable components (e.g., CharacterCard)
- Proper comments, meaningful names, formatting

---

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

Not required but impressive if done:

- Add episode titles in the character detail view by fetching additional data
- Add a dark/light mode toggle
- Store search/filter preferences in localStorage
