## Changes Done

### üîç Character Details Page

- Implemented dynamic routing using React Router to navigate to individual character pages (e.g., `/character/1`).
- Each character page displays:
  - **Name**
  - **Image**
  - **Status**
  - **Species**
  - **Origin**
  - **Last known location**
  - **Number of episodes appeared in**

### üîé Search and Filter Functionality

- Added a search box to filter characters by name.
- Included a dropdown to filter characters by status: Alive, Dead, or Unknown.
- Combined filters work together and persist in the URL via query parameters (e.g., `?name=rick&status=alive`).

### üìÑ Pagination

- Utilized the API's built-in pagination to display 10 characters per page.
- Implemented "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate between pages.
- Ensured navigation does not go beyond the first or last page.

### üì¨ Contact Us Page

- Created a `/contact` route with a form that includes:
  - **Name**
  - **Email**
  - **Message**
  - **Submit** button
- Implemented form validation to ensure:
  - All fields are required.
  - Email follows a valid format.
- On successful submission:
  - Displays a success message.
  - Resets the form fields.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Us Page

- Developed a static `/about` page containing:
  - Information about the application.
  - Developer details.
  - A favorite Rick & Morty quote.

### üßπ Code Quality

- Maintained a clean code structure with reusable components (e.g., `CharacterCard`).
- Added meaningful comments and used descriptive variable and function names.
- Ensured consistent formatting throughout the codebase.
