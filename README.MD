## Implemented Features
- Character Details Page (dynamic route, full info, episode titles)
- Character Search & Filtering (by name and status, persists in localStorage)

- Contact Us Page (form validation, toast message)
- About Us Page (static info, developer, honest quote)
- Navbar for swift and easy navigation (responsive, dark mode toggle)
- Dark/Light Mode Toggle (persists in localStorage)
- Loading Animation (Lottie, centered)

## Improvements
- Episode titles shown in character details
- Search/filter preferences stored in localStorage

## Known Issues
- API errors (e.g., no results) do not show a custom error message
- Lottie loading animation requires internet access
- No backend for contact form (messages not actually sent)
