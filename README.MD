## Project Summary

Rick & Morty Explorer is a single-page React application that lets users explore, search, filter, and view details about characters from the Rick and Morty universe using the public Rick and Morty API.

---

## Implemented Features

- **Character List**: Browse all characters with images, names, status, and species.
- **Character Details Page**: Click a character to view full details (name, image, status, species, origin, last known location, number of episodes).
- **Search & Filter**: Search by name and filter by status (Alive, Dead, Unknown). Filters persist in the URL as query parameters.
- **Pagination**: Next/Previous buttons to navigate pages, showing 10 characters per page. Prevents going past first/last page.
- **Contact Us Page**: Form with name, email, and message. Includes validation and success message on submit.
- **About Page**: Static info about the app, developer, and a Rick & Morty quote.
- **Reusable Components**: CharacterCard, SearchBar, FilterDropdown, and more.
- **Routing**: All pages are accessible via React Router.

## Additional Improvements

- Clean code structure and meaningful variable/component names.
- CSS generated and debugged with ChatGPT for a modern, responsive look.
- Error handling for API requests.
- WakaTime integration for time tracking.
