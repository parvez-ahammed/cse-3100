          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Rick and Morty is an animated sci-fi comedy series that follows the
            misadventures of a brilliant but reckless scientist, Rick Sanchez,
            and his good-hearted but anxious grandson, Morty Smith. Together,
            they travel through space, alternate realities, and bizarre
            dimensions, often facing absurd dangers and moral dilemmas. The show
            blends dark humor, satire, and science fiction, exploring complex
            themes like identity, free will, and the multiverse. Its unique
            storytelling and edgy humor have made it a cult favorite worldwide.
